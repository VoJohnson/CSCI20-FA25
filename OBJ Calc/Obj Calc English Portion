 I initiate my code using #include "Obj  Header.hpp".
 In this header file I have cstdio, stack, and vector. I also have
 shortcuts which are using vector, stack, and printf to help organize
 my codespace and shorten it. In my header file I have a written out
 guide with questions to help organize the process of making an 
 object calculator.
